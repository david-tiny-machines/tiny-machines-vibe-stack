## üöÄ **Quick Start (2 minutes)**

### **Prerequisites**
- **Node.js 18+** ([Download here](https://nodejs.org/))
- **Git** ([Download here](https://git-scm.com/))
- **IDE** *Cursor* ([Download here](https://cursor.com)) or *VS Code* ([Download here](https://code.visualstudio.com/))
- **Claude Code** ([Install here](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/overview))

### **Setup**
```bash
# 1. Clone and disconnect from original repo
git clone https://github.com/david-tiny-machines/tiny-machines-vibe-stack.git my-project
cd my-project
rm -rf .git
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit from Tiny Machines Vibe Stack"

# 2. Install dependencies
npm install

# 3. Start development server
npm run dev
```

**That's it!** Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and you'll see your app running.

### **Try the Demo**
- üìß **Demo Login**: `demo@example.com` / `password`
- üéÆ **Interactive Demo**: Visit [State Management Demo](http://localhost:3000/state-demo)
- üîê **Protected Routes**: Try the [Dashboard](http://localhost:3000/dashboard)

## ü§ñ **AI-Powered Development Workflow**

This stack includes a structured **Plan ‚Üí Build ‚Üí Ship** workflow for AI-assisted development.

### **Try Your First Prototype:**
```bash
# In your project directory, start Claude Code
claude

# Plan what you want to build
/plan "walking tour add-on prototype for travel booking flow to test if customers will book tours during hotel checkout vs planning separately later"

# Build it step by step with AI validation
/build walking-tour-addon  # Repeat until all tasks complete
/build walking-tour-addon
/build walking-tour-addon

# Ship when ready
/ship walking-tour-addon
```

### **What This Gives You**
- üéØ **Smart Planning**: AI breaks features into actionable tasks (2-4 hours per prototype)
- ‚ö° **Quality-First Building**: Every task includes validation (TypeScript, tests, lint)
- üöÄ **Production-Ready Output**: Deploy-ready code with comprehensive testing

---

## üìã **Planning with Product Requirements Documents (PRDs)**

For complex projects or formal product development, you can create detailed Product Requirements Documents and use them directly with the vibe coding workflow.

### **Create a PRD**

**Option 1: Use External Template**
If you don't have a PRD format preference, we recommend this comprehensive template:
**[Professional PRD Template](https://vibecodx.dev/guides/requirements-template)**

**Option 2: Use an existing PRD**
Claude Code (and all LLMs) love markdown files - learn more about them here:
**[Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/)**
```bash
# Convert your PRD into markdown format and then place in the docs/requirements folder
# Then plan directly from it
/plan docs/requirements/my-feature.md
```

### **PRD-to-Code Workflow**

```bash
# 1. Create detailed PRD
/plan docs/requirements/user-dashboard.md

# 2. Build incrementally from PRD
/build user-dashboard
/build user-dashboard  
/build user-dashboard

# 3. Ship when PRD requirements met
/ship user-dashboard
```

### **PRD Benefits**
- **Stakeholder Alignment**: Clear requirements before development
- **Scope Management**: Prevents feature creep during development  
- **Quality Validation**: Built-in acceptance criteria for testing
- **Documentation**: Permanent record of product decisions

## üîê **From Demo to Production**

### **Demo Mode (Default)**
Perfect for initial validation:
- Works immediately with no setup
- Try: `demo@example.com` / `password`
- Full functionality with mock data
- Share prototypes instantly

### **Production Mode (When Validated)**
Scale to real users:
1. Create free [Supabase project](https://supabase.com)
2. Add credentials to `.env.local`:
   ```env
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_project_url
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_anon_key
   ```
3. Restart: `npm run dev`

Seamless transition from prototype to production with real user accounts and data persistence.

---

## üöÄ **Deployment**

### **Share Your Prototype**
```bash
# Push to GitHub, then one-click deploy:
# 1. Connect at vercel.com/new
# 2. Add environment variables (if using production mode)
# 3. Share live link with stakeholders
```

**Works everywhere**: Vercel (recommended), Netlify, Railway, self-hosted
