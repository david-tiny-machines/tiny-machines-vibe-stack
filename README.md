## üé™ **What You Get Out of the Box**

### **üèóÔ∏è Technology Stack (The Foundation)**

**Next.js 15 + React 19** - The core framework that powers everything. Think of this as the engine of your web app that handles page routing, performance optimization, and makes your site load lightning-fast.

**Tailwind CSS 4.0** - The design system that makes everything look professional. Instead of writing custom CSS, you use pre-built classes like "bg-blue-500" or "text-center" to style your app consistently.

**shadcn/ui** - Premium UI components (buttons, forms, modals) that look like they came from a top design agency. No need to design from scratch - just use these polished components.

**Zustand** - Simple state management that keeps your app's data organized. When a user logs in, updates their profile, or makes changes, Zustand ensures everything stays in sync across your entire app.

**TanStack Query** - Smart data fetching that makes your app feel instant. It caches data from your APIs so users don't see loading spinners every time they navigate.

**Supabase** - Your backend-as-a-service that handles user accounts, databases, and authentication. No need to build your own user management system from scratch.

### **üîê User Authentication**
- **Demo Mode**: Test immediately with `demo@example.com` / `password`
- **Production Ready**: Add Supabase configuration when you're ready to go live
- **Protected Routes**: Dashboard and user areas work automatically

### **üé® Professional Design**
- **Modern Components**: Buttons, forms, cards, navigation - all designed and ready
- **Mobile-First**: Built with responsive design principles using Tailwind CSS
- **Customizable**: Change colors, fonts, and styling without breaking anything

### **üìä Data Management**
- **Demo Data**: Works immediately with sample data
- **API Foundation**: Ready to connect to REST APIs (see `/state-demo` for example)
- **Caching**: Smart data loading that makes your app feel fast

### **üõ†Ô∏è Developer Experience**
- **AI-Friendly**: Claude Code works great with this structure
- **Fast Refresh**: See changes instantly as you develop
- **TypeScript**: Catch errors before they reach users

---

## üéØ **Perfect For**

### **Product Managers**
- Validate ideas quickly with working prototypes
- Show stakeholders real functionality, not wireframes
- Collaborate with AI to build features without waiting for developers

### **Founders & Entrepreneurs**
- Launch MVPs in days, not months
- Bootstrap without technical co-founder
- Scale from prototype to production seamlessly

### **Development Teams**
- Consistent starting point for all projects
- Modern best practices baked in
- Focus on business logic, not boilerplate

---

## üîó **Connect to Supabase Backend**

Switch from demo mode to a real backend with user accounts and data persistence:

### **Create Your Supabase Project**
1. Sign up at [supabase.com](https://supabase.com) (free tier available)
2. Create a new project
3. Wait 2-3 minutes for your database to spin up

### **Get Your Configuration**
In your Supabase dashboard:
1. Go to **Settings** ‚Üí **API**
2. Copy your **Project URL** and **anon public key**

### **Add to Your App**
Create a `.env.local` file in your project root:
```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_project_url_here
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_anon_key_here
```

### **Enable Authentication**
In your Supabase dashboard:
1. Go to **Authentication** ‚Üí **Settings**
2. Enable **Email** provider
3. Configure your site URL (e.g., `https://yourapp.vercel.app`)

**That's it!** Your app will automatically switch from demo mode to real user accounts.
